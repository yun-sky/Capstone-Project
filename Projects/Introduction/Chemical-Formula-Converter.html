<h1>
    Chemistry is one of my favourite subjects in school, and I thought it would be cool to combine my interest in chemistry with programming. So I created a program that will take an ionic compound and convert it into its formula. For obvious reasons, this program cannot take in every ionic compound, as I would have to list out all the elements on the periodic table for it to work. However it is still a simple project that helped me understand the basics of python. 

</h1>

<h1><span class="royalblue-highlight">Objective:</span> 
    Objective: Create a program that will take in a chemical name and output a formula. <br>
    Ex. Lithium Oxide → Li2O
</h1>

<h1>
    First, I put the most common metals and non-metals into a dictionary and assigned each name to a list containing their charge and symbol. I then created a variable that will store the user’s chemical name.
</h1> 

<pre class="python"><code>
print("TEST CHEMICAL NAME TO FORMULA: ")
elementconvert = {
    "Lithium": ["Li", ""],
    "Sodium": ["Na", ""],
    "Potassium": ["K", ""],
    "Rubidium": ["Rb", ""],
    "Cesium": ["Cs", ""],
    "Beryllium": ["Be", 2],
    "Magnesium": ["Mg", 2],
    "Calcium": ["Ca", 2],
    "Strontium": ["Sr", 2],
    "Barium": ["Br", 2],
    "Oxide": ["O", 2],
    "Chloride": ["Cl", ""],
    "Sulphide": ["S", 2],
    "Fluoride": ["F", ""],
    "Nitride": ["N", 3],
    "Iron(Iii)": ["Fe", 3],
    "Iron(Ii)": ["Fe", 2],
    "Nickel(Iii)": ["Ni", 3],
    "Nickel(Ii)": ["Ni", 2]
}

chem_name = input("Please enter a formula: ").title().strip()
</code></pre>

<h1>
    Next, I created a function that converts the user’s input into a manageable form. In hindsight, I should have made this code cleaner as even I have a hard time following what each step is doing. Splitting these steps into different functions should make interpreting this code a lot easier.   
</h1>
<pre class="python"><code>
def nomenclature():
    #local Variables
    error = False
    chem_name_list = list(chem_name)
    indices = [i for i, letter in enumerate(chem_name) if letter == " "]

    #Checks if there are spaces inside the user's input
    if " " not in chem_name:
        print("Error, Requires spaces to give a formula")
        error = True
    else:
        while len(indices) > 1 and chem_name not in "(":
            del chem_name_list[max(indices)]
            indices.remove(max(indices))

        #This is for transition metals, or metals with multiple charges
        for letter in chem_name:
            if letter in ")":
                del chem_name_list[indices[0]]
                temp_index = chem_name_list.index(")")+1
                chem_name_list.insert(temp_index, " ")
                indices.append(temp_index)

    return indices, chem_name_list, error

</code></pre>

<h1>
    The next step was assembling the formula into a string by setting each non-metal, metal, and corresponding charges as a variable:

</h1>

<pre class="python"><code>
def calculation():
    try:
        for index in indices:
            metal = (chem_name_list[0:index])
            nmetal = (chem_name_list[index+1:])
            metal = "".join(metal)
            nmetal = "".join(nmetal).capitalize()
        metal_name = elementconvert[metal][0]
        nmetal_name = elementconvert[nmetal][0]
        metalion = elementconvert[metal][1]
        nmetalion = elementconvert[nmetal][1]
        if metalion == nmetalion:
            metalion = ""
            nmetalion = ""
        print(metal_name + str(nmetalion) + nmetal_name + str(metalion))
    except:
        print("ERROR")
</code></pre>

<h1>After creating all the necessary functions, it was time to put it all together:</h1>

<pre class="python"><code>
indices, chem_name_list, error = nomenclature()
if error == False:
    calculation()
try_again = input("Enter 'Y' if you would like to enter another formula (Y/N): ").upper()

while try_again == "Y":
    chem_name = input("Please enter a formula: ").title().strip()
    indices, chem_name_list, error = nomenclature()
    if error == False:
        calculation()
        try_again = input("Enter 'Y' if you would like to enter another formula (Y/N): ").upper()

print("Thanks for stopping By!")
input()
</code></pre>
