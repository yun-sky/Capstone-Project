<h1>Before creating my Tic-Tac-Toe game, I initialized the board for the x's and o's to be displayed on.</h1>

<pre><code>
tictac = [
    ["_", "_", "_"],
    ["_", "_", "_"],
    ["_", "_", "_"]]

</code></pre>

<h1>Next, I had to create a program that will check whether or not a player has won. That means I would have to create a function that
will check each row, column, and cross after every turn. So, I splited each step into its own function to make the process easier.
</h1>

<pre><code>
"""
Each function follows the same process: it stores each value as a list, and if the list only contains one value 
then the program knows that a player has won. 

"""
#Checks each row
def row(player, player2):
    subset = []
    for row in tictac:
        for space in row:
            subset.append(space)
        if "_" not in subset and player2 not in subset:
            print(player + " Won the Game")
            return True
        else:
            subset.clear()

#Checks each column
def column(player, player2):
    subset = []
    for y in range(3):
        for x in range(3):
            subset.append(tictac[x][y])
        if "_" not in subset and player2 not in subset:
            print(player + " Won the Game")
            break
        else:
            subset.clear()

#checks one diagonal
def diagonal(player):
    x = 0
    for y in range(3):
        if tictac[y][y] == "_":
            break
        elif tictac[y][y] == player:
            x += 1
    if x == 3:
        print(player  + " Won the game")

#Checks the other diagonal
def diagonal2(player):
    y = 2
    for x in range(3):
        if tictac[x][y] == "_":
            break
        elif tictac[x][y] == player:
            y -= 1
    if y == 3:
        print(player + "Won the game")

<h1>
    The next function, game, allows the user to input their position on the board and then display it on the screen. This will act as the front-end of the game and will also check if the user has entered an invalid input.
</h1>

<pre class="python"><code>
def game(player2): 
    row = int(input("Enter the row: ")) - 1
    column = int(input("Enter the column: ")) - 1
    player = player2 % 2
    if row >= 3 or column >= 3:
        print("That's too big of an number for this game!\nPlease choose another one")
        return False
    elif row < 3 or column < 3:
        if tictac[row][column] == "_":
            if player == 0:
                tictac[row][column] = "X"
            elif player != 0:
                tictac[row][column] = "O"
        else:
            print("INVALID")
            return False
    for row in tictac:
        print(row)

<h1>
    Finally, I created the backend of the tic-tac-toe game by combining the functions into another function. 
</h1>

<pre class="python"><code>
def final_setup():
    gametime = 0
    while True:
        x = game(gametime)
        if x == False:
            x = True
        else:
            row("X", "O")
            row("O", "X")
            column("X", "O")
            column("O", "X")
            diagonal2("X")
            diagonal2("O")
            diagonal("X")
            diagonal("O")
            gametime += 1

#Calling the function
final_setup()
