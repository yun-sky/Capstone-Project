<h1>After a couple days of grasping the basics of python, my brother, who so happens to also be
    my mentor for this project, gave me this as my first coding assignment. At first, it was a little
    tricky to take on a relatively big assignment, especially for someone with only two days of youtube
    experience, but after a hours of meticulous (and terribly unclean and cluttered) coding, 
    I had finished it.

<h1><span class="royalblue-highlight">Main Objective:</span>
Create a program that will suggest how many bonbons the user should pack and how many boxes they will produce. There are two types of chocolate bonbons, Almond and peanut butter, as well as two types of boxes, round and oval. 
<br><br>
BonBon “A” - Almond<br>
BonBon “B” - Peanut Butter<br>
Oval Box - 11 pieces of chocolate “A”, 4 pieces of chocolate “B”.<br>
Round Box - 7 pieces of chocolate “A”,  4 pieces of chocolate “B”.<br>
</h1>

<h1>
First, I will greet the user by asking for their first and last name.
