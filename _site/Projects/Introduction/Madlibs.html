                <h1>Madlibs is a game that uses a series of randomly picked words to create an out-of-context 
    (and usually odd) story. Most people have played this game before on a piece of paper, but 
    with the usage of variables, input functions and concatenation, we can create a simple 
    program that will take in our words and output a story without words in it! This was one 
    of the first projects I made using python. <br><br>The first step of building this game was finding 
    a mad-libs example to use as a template. I just searched mine up and picked the first one 
    I saw and set each blank as its variable, assigning its names accordingly and making sure 
    that each differs from the other.</h1> 


<pre><code class="python">
#The input function will take in a  the user's input and store it as a variable for me to reference
holiday = input("Enter a holiday: ")

</code></pre>

<h1>So in the end it looked like this:</h1>
<pre><code class="python">
#same as before:
holiday = input("Enter a holiday: ")

#added words:
noun1 = input("Enter a noun: ")
place = input("Enter a place: ")
person = input("Enter a person's name: ")
adjective1 = input("Enter an adjective: ")
body_prt = input("Enter a body part (plural): ")
verb = input("Enter a verb: ")
adjective2 = input("Enter an adjective:")
noun2 = input("Enter a noun: ")
food = input("Enter a type of food: ")
noun3 = input("Enter a plural noun: ")

</code></pre>

<h1>After I assigned all the variables, it was time to put it all together by stuffing the template into a print function. I found this to be the most tedious part, as each variable needed to be in its proper place.  </h1>

<pre><code class="python">
print("I can't believe it's already " + holiday + " I can't wait to put on my " 
+ noun1 + " and visit every " + place + " in my neighborhood. This year, I am going to dress up as " 
+ person + " with " + adjective1 + body_prt + ". Before I " + verb + ", I make sure to grab my " 
+ adjective2 + noun2 + " to hold all of my food. Finally, all of my " + noun3 + 
" are ready to go!")

</code></pre>

<h1>All done! I definitely made a lot of typing errors during this step, but
    this is what the output will look like once it first appears in the command line: </h1>

<pre><code class="plaintext output">
Enter a holiday:

</code></pre>

<h1>Once I plug in a input, the next prompt will show up immediatly after. </h1>

<pre><code class="plaintext output">
Enter a holiday: Christmas Eve
Enter a noun:
    
</code></pre>

<h1>Finally after filling out all the prompts, the story will appear!</h1>

<pre><code class="plaintext output">
Enter a holiday: Christmas Eve
Enter a noun: block of cheese
Enter a place: Burger King
Enter a person's name: John Doe
Enter an adjective: stunning  
Enter a body part (plural): elbows
Enter a verb: skip
Enter an adjective:funny
Enter a noun: jean shorts
Enter a type of food: cheesecake
Enter a plural noun: cats
I can't believe it's already Christmas Eve I can't wait to put on my block of cheese and visit every Burger King 
in my neighborhood. This year, I am going to dress up as John Doe with stunning elbows. Before I skip, I make sure 
to grab my funny jean shorts to hold all of my food. Finally, all of my cats are ready to go!
