            Hello! My name is Sky :). Welcome to my about me page! I am currently a high school student in BC and will attend a post-secondary school to major in computer science starting this September of 2021.
            Occasionally, I enjoy playing a few tunes on the piano and watching animated films.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Frankly, I never thought that I would pursue a career path in computer science; I thought it was not my forte. But during the pandemic, my brother, who is also my mentor for this project, suggested that I learn Python. So, later on, I searched up a tutorial on Python and printed my first hello world. Ever since then, I've loved learning about programming and discovered a new interest.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The past year, between 2020 and 2021, I've only built relatively simple projects in Python, ranging from text-based programs to functioning games (bug-filled but functioning). So now I am excited to have the opportunity to showcase what I have learned through this website and how teaching yourself a new subject can yield satisfying results.

            <u>How did I learn python?</u><br><br>
            I first started by watching a beginners tutorial on Python and following the exercise questions in the python crash course. Most of my resources come from youtube videos, articles and books and a large portion of my time is spent searching for help on StackOverflow (it comes in handy when I am stuck on a problem).<br><br>
            <u>Any difficulties while learning how to program?</u><br><br>
            At first, I sped through the beginner's course material relatively quickly and, much of the content I comprehended. But as the problems got harder to solve, I found it more difficult to extend my learning through practice since most of the suggested projects/exercises were either too difficult or too easy. I slowly realized that it is easier to maintain a consistent learning pattern at the beginning. However, as the learning rate starts to plateau during the more difficult concepts, it becomes increasingly harder to stay motivated and continue learning. <br><br>
            
            <u>What is a more effective approach to learning?</u><br><br>
            Active learning, as opposed to only passive learning, is the most effective way to fully comprehend a concept. While learning how to use python, I engaged in active learning by practicing my coding skills through Leetcode problems and creating projects without the assistance of a tutorial.
